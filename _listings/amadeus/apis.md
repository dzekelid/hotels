  description: "This API allows you to quickly see the detailed information of a single
    hotel, including descriptions, address, GPS location, amenities, awards, lowest
    priced room and all room prices and booking information. \n\nThis API gives you
    more information on a specific property. Optional parameters such as show_sold_out
    & rooms can be used to show sold out rooms and all available rooms. \n\nThe API
    is based on our high-speed hotel pricing cache, which is also used to power the
    Amadeus Hotel Search Engine application. Results are returned very quickly, response
    times are generally under 2s. Our cache has great global coverage and is constantly
    refreshed with the latest prices."
